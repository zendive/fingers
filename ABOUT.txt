- This simple programm is born to improve my typing skills. If it will do the same for You, it will be not just your victory but mine too.

- Before the start, place your hands on the keyboard in such way that forefinger of your left hand lay on [F] key, and forefinger of your right hand on [J] key, the other fingers must stay on the same key-line.

- Two variables like Error Percentage and Typing Speed will change or limit your current level through the training advance. For example if your typing speed bypasses the maximum limit at level finish, then you may go to the next level. If your typing speed is between the minimum and maximum then you will stay at the same level for more practicing. If you below the minimum then you will be asked to lower current level. And at last, remember - no mater what your speed is - keep error percentage as low as possible since correct-typing will save more of your time than just fast-typing, no matter how fast.

- Using [Edit->Configure] you can switch between Keyboard and Numpad training modes and configure their parameters.
